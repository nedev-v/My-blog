This summer I had a great opportunity to combine my staudies with a fascinating travel experience in the heart of the Netherlands - Amsterdam. I visited an annual event organized by Molly.

They are one of the biggest payment services in Europe. What they do is they are helping businesses easily implement payment services without the dependence on a specific payment provider.

As I already mentioned once a year Mollie organizes a networking event. The goal of it is to bring the developers who are somehow connected to Mollie together for one evening for interesting tech presentations and drinks. Most of the people there were expirienced developers who are working in finance. I was so surprised when I found out that I was the only student there. Anyways I had a great time and gained a lot of new knowledge. So let's go a bit into details of the presentations.

The first presenter was Mackenzie Jackson from a belgian company "Aikido Security". His company concentrates on providing auditing and security services uncovering and helping fixing vulnerabilities.

The topic of Mackenzie's presentation was about the fact that open source projects can also have vulnerabilities, so one should be also cautious when choosing one. Even big companies do such mistakes using open source tools that may have hidden dependencies with (yet) unknown vulnerabilities. 

That is why his team used LLM's to uncover hidden threats faster and let the developers know about their findings. This is an interesting method of leveraging LLMs in a cybersecurity field. I have never heard about it before. Mackenzie has shown a lot of interesting (and funny) vulnarabilities that they uncovered during the audits. He also shared the best practices on how to protect our projects, so it was definitely a presentation worth visiting.

The second one was given by a fascinating Karlijn LÃ¶wik. She has a huge expirience in web perfomance and optimization. During her presentation she gave us valuable insight on how to use Chrome's DevTools to reproduce different user expiriences. 

She also tought us that our websites' perfomance can be very different on various devices and in various circumstances even though the Google's Lighthouse score can be very high. At this point she also took a chance to promote her own company called "RUM Vision" that is made to uncover perfomance issues and evaluate your webservice based on loads of different metrics. 

I learned a lot of valuable information during Karlijn's presentation as I haven't had expirience yet with any web perfomance optimization and was new to the topic. Now I can definitely use her tips during my work and personal projects to make user expirience way better.

After these two presentations it was time for networking. I had a couple of drinks and got into a conversation with Mollie's developers. They told me a lot of interesting insights on the fintech sector and payment processing. I also found out about inner structure of the big companies such as Mollie and how they are organized. It was interesting to finally get an idea of how big tech companies and their teams work together to constantly deliver new features and products out to the world. 

I would like to make a separate shout-out to Robin De Graaf. He is a senior PHP developer at Mollie with a lot of expirience. Thanks to him I got an opportunity to have a talk with Mollie's devs and generally have a nice time there during the networking moment. 

I would definitely like to attend this event again and maybe even make it an annual tradition. I got so much knowledge and passion to learn and build cool features and projects and to grow as a developer. I hope that next year I can visit it with more of my friends and colleagues and not alone as it was this time, so we can all share a drink and talk about tech. Like who wants to talk about tech more than tech people, right? xD

Thank you that decided to take your time and follow my journey to this meet up with me.
