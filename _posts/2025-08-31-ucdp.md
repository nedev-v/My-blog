During my final year of studies, I developed a Use-Case Driven Project (UCDP) focused on building a practical system for audio content moderation. The goal of this project was to create a fully functional pipeline that demonstrates how large language models (LLMs) can be leveraged to analyze and moderate audio content efficiently.

The UCDP includes:

1. A modular audio moderation pipeline built with TypeScript, allowing transcription, categorization, and result preparation steps.
2. Integration with OpenAIâ€™s transcription and moderation APIs to automate analysis.
3. A simple React dashboard for human moderators to review flagged content and make decisions.
4. Extensible architecture, enabling easy addition of new moderation steps, AI tools, or features.

This project allowed me to test my skills while gaining a deeper understanding of content moderation and how AI can be leveraged to automate the process of audio moderation. Overall, the UCDP provides not only a functional proof-of-concept but also a roadmap for future research and development in automated audio content moderation. By combining large language models (LLMs), a modular pipeline design, and cloud-based infrastructure, the system is flexible and scalable, capable of evolving to meet the growing demands of online platforms and contributing to safer digital environments.
