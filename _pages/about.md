Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m glad to welcome you to my blog. My name is Oleksandr Nediev, and Iâ€™m a young developer who recently graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Applied Informatics at Howest.

I enjoy many things, but what I love most is solving problems. It doesnâ€™t matter how big or small they areâ€”if solving them can help someone (or even myself), Iâ€™m in! My education reflects my passion: I enjoy finding elegant solutions using modern technologies. One day, I hope to become an entrepreneur and create something that will help many people.

Where am I?
