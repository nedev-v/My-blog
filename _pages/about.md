Hello there! ðŸ‘‹
Iâ€™m glad to welcome you to my blog. My name is Oleksandr Nediev, and Iâ€™m a young developer who recently graduated with a Bachelorâ€™s degree in Applied Informatics at Howest.

I enjoy many things, but what I love most is solving problems. It doesnâ€™t matter how big or small they areâ€”if solving them can help someone (or even myself), Iâ€™m in! My education reflects my passion: I enjoy finding elegant solutions using modern technologies. One day, I hope to become an entrepreneur and create something that will help many people.

Where are you at?
=====

If youâ€™re here, it means youâ€™re either interested in me or in what I write. Let me guide you a bit.

On the left, youâ€™ll find information about me, my socials, and how to get in touch. If thatâ€™s not enough, youâ€™re welcome to read my [CV](/my-blog/cv/) by clicking the appropriate button in the top menu. There, Iâ€™ve described my technical knowledge, experience, and skills in detail. And if you have a proposal or an idea, donâ€™t hesitate to contact me â€” maybe weâ€™ll build something interesting together. Who knows?

Now if you are curious about my blog posts and what I write about feel free to check out my [blog posts](/my-blog/posts/). 

How did I build this website?
=====

This portfolio was created using Jekyll, a static site generator that transforms Markdown files into a fully functional website. Jekyll allowed me to focus on content creation while providing a flexible framework for theming, layouts, and navigation. For this project, I used the AcademicPages template, which provided a clean, professional design with ready-made layouts for posts, projects, and portfolio items. 

During my studies, I became quite familiar with Markdown, often using it for notes and organizing my daily tasks. Its clean and simple syntax also makes styling pages easy, which is a major advantage for me.

The site is hosted on GitHub Pages, which offers free and reliable hosting for static websites. This was my first time working with GitHub Pages. Although I had seen many examples of such websites online, I had never explored how they were built. Originally, this portfolio was created for my "Professional Networking" subject, and my lecturers suggested using GitHub Pages as a deployment option. I saw this as an excellent opportunity to learn something new and gain hands-on experience in deploying GitHub Pages.
